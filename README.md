## 📌 Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1. Import libraries and dataset
2. Clean and visualize the dataset
3. Train a Regression model
4. Evaluate accuracy (R² Score)
5. Predict salary for new experience values
6. Visualize results using a trend line

---

## 🎯 Results
- **Model Accuracy:** ~95%–98% (R² Score)
- **Sample Prediction:**

| Experience (Years) | Predicted Salary |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 2                   | ₹20,000+ approx. |
| 5                   | ₹45,000+ approx. |
| 8                   | ₹75,000+ approx. |

📌 *(Values vary based on dataset used)*
